- Complete chapters 1-3 of ["The Rust Programming Language" book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- Write your first "Hello, World!" and simple calculator programs
- Practice with cargo commands (new, build, run, check)

### Days 3-5: Core Concepts
- Complete chapters 4-6 of the book (ownership, structs, enums)
- Start [Rustlings exercises](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) (variables, functions, if statements)
- Build a command-line to-do application
- Daily practice: 2-3 small coding exercises focusing on fundamentals

### Days 6-7: Collections and Error Handling
- Complete chapters 7-9 (packages/modules, collections, error handling)
- Continue Rustlings exercises (strings, error handling)
- Convert existing code to use proper error handling
- Weekend project: Build a file manipulation tool

## Week 2: Intermediate Features

### Days 8-10: Traits and Generics
- Complete chapters 10-12 (generics, traits, testing)
- Rustlings exercises on traits and generics
- Refactor your previous projects to use traits and generics
- Practice writing unit tests for your code

### Days 11-14: Functional Programming & Closures
- Complete chapters 13-14 (iterators, closures, cargo)
- Implement common algorithms using functional programming style
- Weekend project: Build a text processing tool with advanced features

## Week 3: Systems Programming & Concurrency

### Days 15-17: Smart Pointers & Object-Oriented Features
- Complete chapters 15-17 (smart pointers, concurrency, OOP features)
- Study the std::sync and std::thread modules
- Build a multi-threaded application (e.g., web scraper or file processor)

### Days 18-21: Async Programming
- Learn about Rust's async/await
- Study the tokio or async-std crates
- Convert your threaded application to use async
- Weekend project: Build an asynchronous web server

## Week 4: Advanced Topics & Real-World Development

### Days 22-24: Advanced Pattern Matching & Unsafe Rust
- Complete chapters 18-21 (patterns, advanced features, unsafe Rust)
- Study FFI (Foreign Function Interface) concepts
- Create a binding to a small C library

### Days 25-28: Ecosystem & Final Project
- Learn about important crates (serde, clap, diesel, etc.)
- Study web frameworks (actix-web, rocket, warp)
- Final project: Build a RESTful API with database integration
- Optimize your code for performance

## Daily Habits Throughout

- Spend 30 minutes reading Rust code on GitHub
- Complete at least 2 Rustlings exercises
- Participate in the [Rust forum](https://users.rust-lang.org/) or [r/rust subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/)
- Review and refactor previous day's code
